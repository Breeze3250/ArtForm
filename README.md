# ArtForm

While this project certainly isn't very efficiently coded nor insanely well done, it's the very first coding project I've ever worked on and completed.
As such, it holds a pretty special place in my heart, scuffed as it is. Originally on repl.it, I moved it to GitHub here so that it's more easily accessible.
In particular, I mentioned this project as part of my application for Hack The North (2023), so I am posting this here on GitHub for ease of viewing.
